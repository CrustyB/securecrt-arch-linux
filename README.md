# VanDyke SecureCRT PKGBUILD for Arch Linux

The AUR lacks a PKGBUILD for VanDyke SecureCRT. I've written a basic one. Provide your own license after the installation, otherwise it's a 30 day trial.

# Install

Clone the repo, cd in to it and:

    move SecureCRT/SecureFX file into directory

    aura -S icu66

    makepkg -si

Done.
